Early in April, eXo moves its projects from the centralized SCM [Subversion](https://svn.exoplatform.org) to the Distributed SCM [Git](http://git-scm.com/). Our Git repositories will be hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/exoplatform/).

This move/conversion will be processed the first week of April and all projects will be updated just after (Maven settings, repositories clean-up, …).

Starting on mid-March some migration tests will be processed. **Don't clone any repository on GitHub before April** to contribute to eXo. These repositories will be recreated in the real migration process and you won't be able to merge back (easily) any change done in these repositories.

For any question about this migration you can contact the eXo Software Factory team who is leading this process <exo-swf@exoplatform.com>
