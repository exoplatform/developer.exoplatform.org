<a name="what"></a>
## What?

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The rule

  * We will use only English terms for every declaration of variable, class, attribute, comment...
  * No special characters should be used, even in comments

### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Exception

Exception for terms issued from business logic, with no appropriate translation mentioned in the specification or design.

In fact, the code reviewer has little chance to understand this term if there is no agreed translation.

### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> The solution

HERE YOU CAN DESCRIBE A SOLUTION TO RESPECT THE RULE

<a name="why"></a>
## Why?

English is the Universal Language, so using another language will assume
that the code written is targeted to only some people, which is not the
purpose of eXo OpenSource code.
