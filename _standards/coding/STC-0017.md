## What?

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The rule

Unused Private Method detects when a private method is declared but is unused.

### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> The solution

You have to check the source code to know if the it's some dead code or not (mainly in Groovy Templates).

<a name="why"></a>
## Why?

Private methods that are never executed are dead code. Dead code means
unnecessary, inoperative code that should be removed. This helps in
maintenance by decreasing the maintained code size, making it easier to
understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.

In the following two cases, private methods are not considered as dead code
by SonarQube :

  * Private empty constructors that are intentionally used to prevent any direct instantiation of a class.
  * Private methods : `readObject(...)`, `writeObject(...)`, `writeReplace(...)`, `readResolve(...)` which can contractually be
  used when implementing the Serializable interface.
