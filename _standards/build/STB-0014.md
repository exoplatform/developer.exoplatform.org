## What?

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The rule

All **new developments** have to follow naming standards for groupIds and artifactIds defined below.

All **existing projects** have to schedule to refactor and clean their build accordingly in a future major release.

### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> The solution

Let's suppose our project name or acronym is `aaa`

  * `aaa` must have a length <= 8 characters
  * `aaa` is in lowercase
  * `aaa` is compound of alphabetical characters only (no numbers, no special characters, ...).

For *groupId* we apply these rules on our project :

1. Its groupId is `**org**.exoplatform.aaa` if `aaa` is a *public* project
2. Its groupId is `**com**.exoplatform.aaa` if `aaa` is a *private* project
3. A project (a buildable unit released as a whole) *uses a unique groupId*

For all `artifactIds` defined in our project we apply these rules :

1. An artifactId is compound of lowercase alphabetical characters and hyphens (no number, no others symbols, ...)
1. The artifactId of the root module is `aaa`
1. A submodule always starts by the artifactId of its ancestor and adds its own specific name after an hyphen (**-**).

    * **Example:** Our project main artifactId is `aaa`, thus its submodules artifactIds will be `aaa-bbb`, `aaa-ccc`, ... and
submodules of `aaa-bbb` will have the artifactId `aaa-bbb-ccc`, `aaa-bbb-ddd` ...

<a name="why"></a>
## Why?

* **Readability** : we can easily browse a project and its modules and find where an artifacts comes from in the hierarchy (in
the file system but also in the IDE).
* **Privacy/Architecture** : The groupId naming rule for public vs private projects allows to quickly check that a public project
(`**org**.exoplatform.\*`) doesn't rely on any private artifacts (`**com**.exoplatform.\*`).
