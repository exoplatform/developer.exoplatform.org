<a name="what"></a>
## What?

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The rule

We will need to document:

  * [Control statements](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html)
  * [Local variables](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html)
  * Portions of complex codes.

### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> The solution

Each type of comment will be used for a specific need:

  * **Use English**: Comments (documentation or code) will be written in English language.
  * **Don't use javadoc comments style**: Documentation comments are obviously reserved for the utility JavaDoc and will be
  placed before each attribute, method, class.
  * **Don't use C style comments**: The C style comments (/ * ... * /) will be used during the implementation phase, to comment
   out portions of code that will eliminate thereafter. This type of comment is very similar to that used for JavaDoc, it is
   best to use it only in this context.
  * **Always use single line comments** : The comment of "single line" ( // ) will always be used to document the logic
  implementation of the code, even if it's in multiple lines.
  * **Use TODO comments** : If you want to leave yourself a note about a piece of code that you need to fix, preface the
  comment with TODO. Format:

{% highlight java %}

    // TODO: some necessary statements have to be added here

{% endhighlight %}

<a name="why"></a>
## Why?

The important thing to remember is that you must document the code only in order to **add clarity**.
Comments added to JavaDoc are not sufficient, you need to include comments in the body of the function to describe your work.
The goal is to make your job easier to understand, maintain and evolve.
