<a name="what"></a>
## What?

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The rule

Never use classes from the following packages (and sub-packages) : `sun.*`

### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> The solution

Find an third party libraries offering the same service or write our own.

<a name="why"></a>
## Why?

1.  We must be compliant with the eXo Platform Supported Environments requirements. The eXo Platform must be compatible with
several JVM Vendors (2011/05/02 : Oracle (Sun) 1.6, IBM 1.6, OpenJDK 1.6) and not all
of them provide sun.* packages.
2.  Here is the disclaimer from Oracle (Sun) :
<blockquote>
  <p>The sun.* packages are not part of the supported, public interface.
     A Java program that directly calls into sun.* packages <u>is not guaranteed
     to work on all Java-compatible platforms</u>. In fact, such a program is not
     guaranteed to work even in future versions on the same platform.</p>
