## What?

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The rule

All **new developments** have to follow the standard organization of Maven projects defined below.
All **existing projects** have to schedule to refactor and clean their build accordingly in a future major release.

### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> The solution

1. The **main POM of the project must extends the latest version of the exo parent pom** (and teams have to ensure they are
following its updates).

2. Modules have to use a **"natural" inheritance** : A module always inherit from the module in the direct upper directory.

3. A **module must always be named like the artifactId** of the artifact it contains

4. The **number of modules has to be reduced to its minimum**. Reasons which justify to create a new module are :

    * a Maven constraint like 1 module = 1 package (ear, war, jar ...)
    * a really large code base thus the split eases to distribute developments across developers.
    * a need to reuse inside or outside the project a module which will provide the strict minimum set of code and dependencies

5. **Sub-modules and inheritance levels have to be reduced to the minimum**. Reasons which justify to create an inheritance level
 are :

    * a really large set of modules in the same level (> 20) which decrease the easiness of the navigation in project's sources
    * a need to share some maven settings between several sub-modules using the inheritance

<a name="why"></a>
## Why?

1. To **reduce the number of artifacts** to ease the management of the project in the IDE and to **speedup the build time** (more
artifacts to manage = more I/Os used = slowness).
1. To avoid problems with Maven plugins that misuse Maven module names and artifacts identifiers.
1. To avoid issues on windows with too long paths due to a too large number of directories, artifacts...
1. To **ease** the debugging of Maven problems by reducing the number of inheritance levels
1. To **share** our Maven experience by reusing settings and plugin versions proposed by a common parent pom.
