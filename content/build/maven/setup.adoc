= Maven - Setup guide

== Prerequisites

To build eXo projects you need to install a Java http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK] 11 and *Apache Maven 3.6+*.

== Configure Apache Maven
Using link:../resources/build/maven/settings.xml[our template] create a file `settings.xml` in your `home directory` under a directory called `.m2` (if you already launched maven this directory must already exist and it should contain a subdirectory `repository` where Maven stores all artifacts it processes).
In the `~/.m2/settings.xml` configuration file you have to fill your credentials to access to protected binaries or to publish artifacts on repository.exoplatform.org. For a better security, you can encrypt passwords in your settings file, however you must first configure a master password. For more information on both server passwords and the master password, see the http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[Guide to password encryption] and the dedicated chapter in the http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/appendix-settings-sect-encrypting-passwords.html[Maven Reference Guide].

When your setup is done you can activate the following profiles :

* `-Pexo-release` : Automatically activated while releasing projects. This profile is also activated on our CI server. Your GPG key must be configured.
* `-Pexo-private` : To access to private binaries on repository.exoplatform.org (eXo employees only).
* `-Pexo-staging` : To access to staging binaries (releases in validation) on repository.exoplatform.org (eXo employees only). *TAKE CARE TO ACTIVATE IT ONLY IF REQUIRED.* These repositories are delivering binaries considered by maven as released but allowed to be replaced. Maven never updates released binaries thus you have to cleanup your local repository to grab an updated version.
