= Maven - Checks

When building a project, beyond compilation and packaging, some checks are performed.

== Unit tests

When a project is built, the unit tests are automatically executed.
If one of the unit tests fails, the project build fails.

== Test coverage

When a project is built on our Continuous Integration server, a check is done on the test coverage ratio to make sure it does not decrease.
The test coverage ratio is set in each Maven module in the property `exo.test.coverage.ratio`. For example

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <exo.test.coverage.ratio>0.72</exo.test.coverage.ratio>
</properties>
----

The value is set between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%).
If the new test coverage is lower than the one set in the Maven configuration, the PR is automatically rejected.
The rules to change this test coverage ratio are:

** it can *NEVER* be decreased
** when a developer increases the test coverage, he CAN (but this is highly recommended) increase the ratio. 
** ratio must always be defined with a 2 digits precision (for example 0.64, not 0.6)

=== How to run this check locally

The test coverage check is triggered when the `coverage` Maven profile is activated.
Therefore, in order to run this check locally, you must activate this profile:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install -Pcoverage
----

In case the check passes succesfully, you will see this kind of message:

[source,shell]
----
[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.7.6.201602180812:check (check-coverage) @ platform-component-organization ---
[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'eXo PLF:: Platform - Organization Model Integration' with 36 classes
[INFO] All coverage checks have been met.
----

In case the check fails, you will see this kind of message:

[source,shell]
----
[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.7.6.201602180812:check (check-coverage) @ platform-component-organization ---
[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'eXo PLF:: Platform - Organization Model Integration' with 36 classes

=== How to check if the ration can be increased in a module

According to <<id-test-coverage,the rules about the minimum test coverage ratio update>>, if a contributor increases the test coverage ratio, he/she can update the minimum ratio.
But Maven does not give the actual value in its standard output (console).
Instead, this value is available in the jacoco reports, in `target/site/test-coverage-ut/index.html`. 
Here is an example:

image:maven-test-coverage-report.png[alt="Test Coverage Report",width="700",align="center"]

This report gives the test coverage on each package and the total test coverage of the Maven module.
This last value is the one checked during the test coverage check.
If this value is higher than the one set in the prooperty `exo.test.coverage.ratio`, it can be updated in the pom.xml.
