= Git - Workflow

Our workflow is built on two principles :

* The *repository architecture* (development vs blessed) that has to be followed by *all projects involved in products* produced eXo (and thus that require to be supported).
* The *branching model* that has to be followed by _all projects_ at eXo

== Repository architecture

Aiming +security+ and backup purpose, we are using two repository kinds (owned by two distinct github organizations).

These are `blessed` and `development` repositories hosted respectively on https://github.com/exoplatform[exoplatform], https://github.com/exodev[exodev] and https://github.com/exo-addons[exo-addons] organizations.

Development repositories are forked from blessed repositories.

*This strategy is applied to all repositories/projects involved in eXo products.* Others projects are using a single repository hosted on "exoplatform" organization.

=== Development repository

This repository is the developers repository. The main development branch is `develop` branch. Depending the contribution kind (one shot contribution or feature contribution), the developer can use a dedicated `feature` branch if needed.
The most of development activity will be done in this repository by a lot of contributors :

* `maintainers` (formerly known `Maintenance FT`) : To develop fix. These developments are done in dedicated `fix` branches (more details below).
* `all other feature teams` : To do one shot contribution and handle feature branch life cycle.

In this repository, `develop` branch and `feature` branch will be under CI.

=== Blessed repository

In this repository you can find `stable` branches and release tags.
Only some people are able to write on this repository :

* `maintainers` : To integrate pull request on stable branches.
* `release manager` : To perform release operations on stable (supported) branches.

The continuous integration is applied on stables branches (`stable/*`) on blessed repository.

== Branching model

Branching model are 6 kinds of branch :

* `develop` : Develop branch contains the latest delivered development changes.
* `feature/xxx` : Feature branches are dedicated branch for one big feature (lot of commits), "xxx" is the feature name.
* `stable/xxx` : Stable branch are used to perform releases and write / accept fix. "xxx" is the stable version name (e.g 1.0.x).
* `fix/xxx` : Fix branch is dedicated to integrate bugfix on Develop branch. If needed the fix is then cherry pick on stable branch.
* `integration/xxx` : Integration branches are dedicated branch to automatic integration task (like Crowdin translation).
* `poc/xxx` : Poc branches are dedicated branch to develop a Prove of Concept (PoC).

=== Develop Branch

Develop branch contains the latest delivered development changes.
This is our backbone where all the different fix and new feature are mixed with each other.

== Feature Branch

Feature branches are dedicated branch to develop a new feature.

=== Actions

==== Create a new Feature Branch

*When:* A new feature is specified and planified.

*Who:* Ops

*How:*

* If you want the branch deploy on Acceptance, do not create the branch by yourself but create an ITOP ticket on Jira for the full package (Git Branches + CI + Acceptance server(s) ).
* If itâ€™s a local feature project without need for CI or Acceptance you can create it by yourself.

==== Rebase Develop to Feature Branch

*When:* when needed or at least weekly.

*Who:* developer or TL.

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout feature/x
git rebase develop
git push --force
----

* To do it ONLY if develop branch is ok (build + acceptance ok) otherwise you will distribute bad code everywhere
* To do it for all projects in a given FB at the same time (to keep the coherency)

==== Merge Feature Branch to Develop

*When:* Feature has been successfully tested by FQA. VPs give a GO.

*Who:* Team responsible of the branch with support of team responsible of each project

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git checkout feature/x
git rebase -i origin/develop
(remove initial commit)
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge --no-ff feature/x
git push
----

==== Remove a Feature Branch

*When:* Just after finishing the work of Feature Team

*Who:* TL

*How:* Reopen previously created ITOP ticket on Jira to remove the full package ( Branches + CI + Acceptance ).

== Fix Branch

Fix Branch are dedicated branch to fix a bug. The validation process may be different if the bug has been raised by FQA/TQA or by SM.

A fix branch is always created from Develop branch (except exceptional circumstance: fix on stable only).

.Git Workflow - Fix Branch
image::git-workflow-fix-branch.png[Git Workflow - Fix Branch, 400, align=center, link={imagesdir}/git-workflow-fix-branch.png]

=== Actions

==== Create a Fix Branch

*When:* A Jira issue has been created, time to resolve it is already estimated.

*Who:* Team responsible to fix the issue.

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b fix/issue
git push
----

==== Merge a Fix Branch to Develop

*When:*

* If issue raised by TQA/FQA: After Engineering test
* If issue raised by SM: After SM test

*Who:*

* If issue raised by TQA/FQA: Team responsible to fix the issue
* If issue raised by SM: SM

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git checkout fix/issue
git pull
git rebase origin/develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge fix/issue --squash
git commit -a
git push
----

==== Remove a Fix Branch

*When:* After the merge of the fix branch to Develop

*Who:* Team responsible to fix the issue.

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git push origin --delete fix/issue
git branch -d fix/issue
----

== Stable Branch

Stable branch are used to perform releases and write / accept fix.

=== Actions

==== Create a new Stable Branch

*When:* When create the first Release Candidate version

*Who:* Ops

*How:* With a script similar to [createFB.sh](https://github.com/exoplatform/swf-scripts/blob/master/createFB.sh)

==== Create a Fix Branch to fix Stable Branch

*In exceptional circumstance*

*When:* A fix need to be done on a specific version but not on the on development version (fix a performance issue for instance)

*Who:* Team responsible to fix the issue after a Go from SM.

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git checkout stable/5.3.x
git pull
git checkout -b fix/5.3.x/issue
----

==== Merge a Fix Branch to Stable

*In exceptional circumstance*

*When:* After SM test

*Who:* SM Team

**How:**
[source,shell]
----
git checkout fix/5.3.x/issue
git checkout stable/5.3.x
git pull
git merge fix/5.3.x/issue --squash
git commit -a
git push
----

==== Remove a Fix Branch

*When:* After the merge of the fix branch to stable branch

*Who:* SM

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git push origin --delete fix/5.3.x/issue
git branch -d fix/5.3.x/issue
----

==== Perform a release

*When:* After PO gives a GO.

*Who:* Ops release managers

*How:*
[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:exoplatform/xxx.git
cd xxx
# You checkout the release branch on which you need to perform a release.
git checkout stable/A.B.x
# You follow the classical maven release process
mvn release:prepare
mvn release:perform
----

==== Move a release tag

*In really special case* (when the test campaign show a critical issue after tagging but before nexus publishing) release manager still can apply a last minute commit and move the tag.

*When:* PO gives a GO.

*Who:* Ops release managers

**How:**
[source,shell]
----
# After your commit, just delete the remote tag, and create another one in this way
git tag -d 1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.0
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin 1.0.0
----

== Integration Branch

Integration branches are dedicated branch to automatic integration task (like Crowdin translation for instance).

=== Actions
