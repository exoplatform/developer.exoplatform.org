= Git - Workflow

eXo Platform product relies on a set of Git repositories :

* https://github.com/Meeds-io[*meeds-io*]: Meeds-io association product Git organization. eXo Platform still the main contributor and maintainer of the source code provided by the association. Thus, we will use the same process for this repository as any other eXo Platform repository.

* https://github.com/exoplatform[*exoplatform*]: eXo Platform Git organization having private and public repositories. This organization has the major part of source code of eXo Platform product, Software Factory tools, Tribe addon...

* https://github.com/exo-docker[*exo-docker*]: eXo Platform Docker Images used mainly by Ops for Software Factory and Product Deployments.

* https://github.com/exo-addons[*exo-addons*]: eXo Platform Git organization used for non-supported addons.

* https://github.com/exo-archives[*exo-archives*]: eXo Platform Git archived repositories.

* https://github.com/exo-puppet[*exo-puppet*]: eXo Platform Git repositories for automatic Deployments and its configurations tooling.

== CI/CD

The CI/CD is applied on the following branches:

* `stable/*` : during Test Compaign of a minor or major release, when the FTs disn't started to work on new features yet.

* `develop` : Feature Teams development phase.

== Branching model

Branching model are 6 kinds of branch :

* `develop : Develop branch contains the latest delivered development changes.

* `feature/xxx : Feature branches are dedicated branch for one big feature (lot of commits), "xxx" is the feature name.

* `stable/xxx` : Stable branch are used to perform releases and write / accept fix. "xxx" is the stable version name (e.g 1.0.x).

* `fix/xxx` : Fix branch is dedicated to integrate bugfix on Develop branch. If needed the fix is then cherry pick on stable branch.

* `integration/xxx` : Integration branches are dedicated branch to automatic integration task (like Crowdin translation).

* `poc/xxx` : Poc branches are dedicated branch to develop a Prove of Concept (PoC).

=== Develop Branch

Develop branch is the production ready branch which is, in general case, the CI/CD production branch.

It contains the latest delivered development changes. This is our backbone where all the different fix and new feature are mixed with each other.
