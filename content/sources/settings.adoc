== GitHub

GitHub is the platform we choose to host our Git repositories. *To contribute to eXo projects you have to create a https://www.github.com/[GitHub] account.*

Please follow the github guides to setup your environment.

== Git Configuration

It is recommended to create an SSH private key (with a password) and to use it to access to your Git(Hub) repositories (see Github guides above).

By default you have at least to setup your default identity that will be used for all git instances on the system if you donâ€™t override them locally.
