== Features

=== Create

*From existing data*

[source,shell]
----
cd  <DIRECTORY>
git init
git add .
git commit
----

*From existing repo*

[source,shell]
----
git clone <EXISTING_REPO> <NEW_REPO>
----

default protocol is ssh
EXISTING_REPO is a local path or a remote URL, for examples :

* _path_ : ~/repository.git
* _ssh_ : git@host:repository.git
* _http(s)_ : https://username@host/repository.git

=== Update

*Fetch latest changes from origin*

[source,shell]
----
git fetch
----

this does not merge them

*Pull latest changes from origin*

[source,shell]
----
git pull
----

does a fetch followed by a merge

In case of conflict, resolve the conflict and

[source,shell]
----
git am —resolve
----

=== Track Files

*Start tracking files*

[source,shell]
----
git add <FILES>
----

*Interactive selection of files to track*

[source,shell]
----
git add -i
----

*Move/Rename a file*

[source,shell]
----
git mv <OLD_NAME> <NEW_NAME>
git mv <OLD_PATH> <NEW_PATH>
----

*Stop tracking and delete files in working directories*

[source,shell]
----
git rm <FILES>
----

*Stop tracking but keep files in working directory*

[source,shell]
----
git rm —cached <FILES>
----

[[commit]]
Commit
~~~~~~

*Commit all local changes*

[source,shell]
----
git commit -a +
----

*Commit messages*

Commits must relate to a JIRA issue.
Convention for messages inspired by http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[this article] :

* The first line must be short (50 chars or less) and auto-descriptive
in a format " ", for example `AM-101 : Fix the behavior of archives download`
* Write your commit message in the present tense: `Fix bug` and not `Fixed bug`.
* The second line is blank.
* Next lines optionally define a short summary of changes (wrap them to about 72 chars or so).

Example :

[source,shell]
----
AM-101 : Fix the behavior of archives download

* —no-cache has no effect on it
* The add-ons manager always retry to download the archive from the
downloadUrl. The download is skipped if the local file exists, it has
the same size as the remote one and its modifiedDate is > to the remote
one (It will allow to install new SNAPSHOTs without enforcing to
download the archive each time)
* The same behavior is applied for all URLs (http(s), file) +
----

=== Publish

*Prepare a patch for other developers*

[source,shell]
----
git format-patch origin
----

*Push changes to origin*

[source,shell]
----
git push origin <BRANCH>
----

Use option `--all` to push all local references (branches, tags..), `--tags` to push all tags,
`--force` to push non fast-forward changes (must be avoided to not risk to loose commits)

*Make a version or milestone*

[source,shell]
----
git tag <TAG_NAME>
----

=== Branch

*List all branches*

[source,shell]
----
git branch
----

*Switch to the BRANCH branch*

[source,shell]
----
git checkout <BRANCH>
----

*Merge branch B1 into branch B2*

[source,shell]
----
git checkout <B2>
git merge <B1>
----

*Create branch based on HEAD*

[source,shell]
----
git branch <BRANCH>
----

*Create branch based on another*

[source,shell]
----
git branch <NEW> <BASE>
----

*Delete a local branch*

[source,shell]
----
git branch -d <BRANCH>
----

*Delete a remote branch*

[source,shell]
----
git push <origin> :<BRANCH>
----

=== Remote

*List all your remote repositories*

----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:exoplatform/platform.git
----

*Rename a remote repository*

[source,shell]
----
$ git remote rename upstream foo
----

*Delete a remote repository*

[source,shell]
----
$ git remote rm upstream foo
----

=== Browse

*Files changed in working directory*

[source,shell]
----
git status
----

*Changes to tracked files*

[source,shell]
----
git diff
----

*Changes between ID1 and ID2*

[source,shell]
----
git diff <ID1> <ID2>
----

*History of changes*

[source,shell]
----
git log
----

*Who changed what and when in a file*

[source,shell]
----
git blame <FILE>
----

*A commit identified by ID*

[source,shell]
----
git show <ID>
----

*A specific file from a specific ID*

[source,shell]
----
git diff <ID>:<FILE>
----

*Search for patterns*

[source,shell]
----
git grep <PATTERN> <PATH>
----

=== Revert

*Return to the last committed state*

[source,shell]
----
git checkout -f | git reset —hard
----

you cannot undo a hard reset

*Revert the last commit*

[source,shell]
----
git revert HEAD
----

Creates a new commit

*Revert specific commit*

[source,shell]
----
git revert <ID>
----

Creates a new commit

*Fix the last commit*

[source,shell]
----
git commit -a —amend
----

after editing the broken files

*Checkout the ID version of a file*

[source,shell]
----
git checkout <ID> <FILE>
----

*Restoring lost commits*

So, you just did a `git reset --hard HEAD^` and threw out your last
commit. Well, it turns out you really did need those changes. You’ll
never be able to implement that algorithm that perfectly twice, so you
need it back. Don’t fear, git should still have your commit. When you do
a reset, the commit you threw out goes to a `dangling` state. It’s
still in git’s datastore, waiting for the next garbage collection to
clean it up. So unless you’ve ran a `git gc` since you tossed it, you
should be in the clear to restore it.

[source,shell]
----
git cherry-pick ORIG_HEAD
----

*HEAD vs ORIG_HEAD*

`ORIG_HEAD` is previous state of `HEAD`, set by commands that have
possibly dangerous behavior, to be easy to revert them. It is less
useful now that Git has reflog: `HEAD&#64;{1}` is roughly equivalent to
`ORIG_HEAD` (`HEAD&#64;{1}` is always last value of `HEAD`, `ORIG_HEAD`
is last value of `HEAD` before dangerous operation).

*Removing a File from Every Commit (Powerful filter-branch)*

This occurs fairly commonly. Someone accidentally commits a huge binary
file with a thoughtless `git add .`, and you want to remove it
everywhere. Perhaps you accidentally committed a file that contained a
password, and you want to make your project open source. filter-branch
is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. To
remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history, you can use
the `--tree-filter` option to `filter-branch`:

[source,shell]
----
git filter-branch —tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
----

The `--tree-filter` option runs the specified command after each
checkout of the project and then recommits the results. In this case,
you remove a file called passwords.txt from every snapshot, whether it
exists or not. If you want to remove all accidentally committed editor
backup files, you can run something like
`git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f *~' HEAD`.
Using `--index-filter` with `git rm` yields a significantly faster
version. Like with using `rm filename`, `git rm --cached filename` will
fail if the file is absent from the tree of a commit. If you want to
`completely forget` a file, it does not matter when it entered
history, so we also add `--ignore-unmatch`:

[source,shell]
----
git filter-branch —index-filter 'git rm —cached —ignore-unmatch passwords.txt' HEAD
----
