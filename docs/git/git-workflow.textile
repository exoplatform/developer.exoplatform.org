h2. Branching model

Branching model is quite simple, there are 4 kinds of branch :
* @master@ : Master branch is used as main branch.
* @feature/xxx@ : Feature branches are dedicated branch for one big feature (lot of commits), "xxx" is the feature name.
* @stable/xxx@ : Stable branch are used to perform releases and write / accept fix. "xxx" is the stable version name (e.g 1.0.x).
* @fix/xxx@ : Fix branch is dedicated to integrate bugfix on stable branch. When the branch is ready, a pull request will be done. "xxx" could be for example "PROJECT-12345".

h2. Repository architecture

Aiming security and backup purpose, we are using two repository kinds (owned by two distinct organizations). There are @development@ and @blessed@ repositories.
Both repository set are owned by two organizations : "exoplatform":https://github.com/exoplatform and "exodev":https://github.com/exodev.
Development repositories are forked from blessed repositories.

In this repository you can find stable branches and release tags. There is master branch also (as backup).
Only some people are able to write on this repository :
* @maintainers@ (formerly known as @sl3@) : To integrate pull request to stable branches.
* @release manager@ : To perform release operations.
* @keepers@ : Repository keepers are @Project Leader@, @Team Leader@ and @Technical Leader@. Keepers are able to pull changes from dev to blessed when the master is stable enough.

The continuous integration is applied on stables branches (@stable/1.0.x@, @stable/1.1.x@, etc). No ci for master on blessed repository.

This repository is the developers repository. The main development branch is master branch. Depending the contribution kind (one shot contribution or feature contribution), the developer can use a dedicated feature branch if needed.
The most of development activity will be done in this repository by a lot of contributors :
* @maintainers@ : To write stable fix on some stable version.
* @all development teams@ : To do one shot contribution and handle feature branch life cycle.

In this repository, only master branch will be under CI. The CI on feature branch is not supported yet, if you want to have a ci, you will need to merge the branch (only when the branch is stable enough).

h2. Flow

h3. New feature

When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the master branch.

{% highlight sh %}
$ git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature master
Switched to a new branch "feature/my-new-feature"
{% endhighlight %}

Finished features may be merged into the master branch definitely add them to the upcoming release:

{% highlight sh %}
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge --no-ff feature/my-new-feature
Updating ea1b82a..05e9557
(Summary of changes)
$ git branch -d feature/my-new-feature
Deleted branch feature/my-new-feature (was 05e9557).
$ git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

The @--no-ff@ flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature. Compare:
!git-merge-without-ff.png!

In the latter case, it is impossible to see from the Git history which of the commit objects together have implemented a feature—you would have to manually read all the log messages. Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), is a true headache in the latter situation, whereas it is easily done if the @--no-ff@ flag was used.

Yes, it will create a few more (empty) commit objects, but the gain is much bigger that that cost.

Unfortunately, I have not found a way to make @--no-ff@ the default behavior of git merge yet, but it really should be.

h3. One shot contribution

One shot contribution is the simplest case. Just commit directly on master branch and push it to dev repository.
Assuming your remote origin is development repository :

{% highlight sh %}
$ git checkout master
Switched to a new branch "master"
{% endhighlight %}

Now commit your changes. Then you only need to push your commits to origin :

{% highlight sh %}
$ git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Fix a stable version

Each stable branch on blessed repository can be updated via Pull Request. Before to do you pull request, let's create and publish your fix on dedicated @fix/xxx@ branch on development repository.
Assuming you are working on issue PROJECT-12345, you already configured two remote repository :
* @origin@ : The cloned repository (development).
* @upstream@ : The blessed repository.
Your clone was done from development repository.

Create fix branch :

{% highlight sh %}
$ git checkout -b fix/PROJECT-12345 upstream/stable/1.0.x
Switched to a new branch "fix/PROJECT-12345"
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can write your code, and commit these changes. When the fix is ready to be integrated to stable branch on blessed repository, let's publish your code :

{% highlight sh %}
$ git push origin fix/PROJECT-12345
{% endhighlight %}

Now your contribution is pushed in dedicated branch on development repository, you can do a pull request. On github project page (dev repository) click on !git-pull-request.png! and ask  the merge from @fix/PROJECT-12345@ (dev repository) to @stable/1.0.x@ (blessed repository).

Last step is to fill the pull request URL on jira issue. Go to jira issue and fill pull request field :

!git-jira-pull-request.png!

h3. Integrate a fix to stable version

When a pull request is reviewed, validated and ready to be integrated, @maintainers@ will merge the pull request.
You already configured two remote :
* @origin@ : The cloned repository (blessed).
* @dev@ : The development repository.
Your clone was done from blessed repository.

{% highlight sh %}
$ git checkout stable/1.0.x
Switched to branch 'stable/1.0.x'
$ git merge --no-ff dev/fix/PROJECT-12345
Updating ea1b82a..05e9557
(Summary of changes)
$ git push origin stable/1.0.x
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Update blessed master branch.

When the master branch is stable enough on development repository, repository keepers have to move commits from development to blessed repository.
Since this operation don't perform merging operation, it's quite simple.
You already have configured two remotes :
* @origin@ : The cloned repository (blessed).
* @dev@ : The development repository.
Your clone was done from blessed repository.

h3. Perform a release

The release is in charge of release manager. The release is performed directly on blessed repository on stable branch.
Assuming your remote origin is the blessed repository :

{% highlight sh %}
$ git checkout stable/1.0.x
Switched to a new branch "stable/1.0.x"
{% endhighlight %}

Now, let's do your release operations (mvn release:prepare & mvn release:perform).

h3. Move a release tag

In special case (when the test campaign show a critical issue after taging but before nexus publishing) release manager still can apply a last minute commit and move the tag.
After your commit, just delete the remote tag, and create another one in this way :

{% highlight sh %}
$ git tag -d 1.0.0
$ git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.0
$ git tag 1.0.0
$ git push origin 1.0.0
{% endhighlight %}
